# hydrants
 A web app that tells a user if they are within 15 feet of a fire hydrant in the city of Buffalo New York. This tool was created for the 2018 Civic Innovation Challenge using the https://data.buffalony.gov/Public-Safety/Fire-Hydrants/jxqq-q5cq dataset that show's the locations of all fire hydrants in the city of Buffalo.
